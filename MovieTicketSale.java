Note that the decimal numbers are output with two decimal places.
Input: The input to the program consists of the movie name, adult ticket price, child ticket price, number of adult tickets sold, number of child tickets sold, and percentage of the gross amount to be donated to the charity.

/*
 * Step-by-step algorithm:
 * Step 1: Start
 * Step 2: Define variables to store the movie name, adult ticket price, child
 * ticket price, number of adult tickets sold,
 * number of child tickets sold, percentage of the gross amount donated to the
 * charity, gross amount, amount donated, and net sale amount.
 * Step 3: Create a scanner object to receive user input.
 * Step 4: Prompt user to input the movie name, adult ticket price, child ticket
 * price, number of adult tickets sold, number of child tickets sold, and
 * percentage of the gross amount to be donated to the charity.
 * Step 5: Use formulas to caiculate the grossAmount, amountDonated and netSaleAmount.
 *         grossAmount = adultTicketPrice * noOfAdultTicketsSold + childTicketPrice * noOfChildTicketsSold;
           amountDonated = grossAmount * percentDonation / 100;
           netSaleAmount = grossAmount - amountDonated;
 * Step 6: Use a String variable to store and format all of the output information.
 * Step 7: Output the information.
 * Step 8: End.
